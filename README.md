## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (recommended: Node.js 20+)
- AWS S3 bucket with appropriate permissions
- AWS Cognito User Pool (already configured)
- AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd s3-file-browser
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Option A: Automatically create IAM user (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   # Run the IAM setup script
   ./create-iam-user.sh my-bucket-name
   
   # This will:
   # - Create an IAM user
   # - Create and attach necessary policies
   # - Generate access keys
   # - Save credentials to .env.credentials
   
   # Merge credentials into .env.local
   cat .env.credentials >> .env.local
   ```

3. **Option B: Manual setup**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your AWS credentials:

   ```env
   # AWS S3 Configuration
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_here
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key_here
   AWS_REGION=us-east-1

   # AWS Cognito Configuration
   NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=eu-west-1_8z9y5UukG
   NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=5j11hrr7qev1r38et7rh59htcg
   NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_URL=eu-west-18z9y5uukg.auth.eu-west-1.amazoncognito.com
   ```

4. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
   - You'll be automatically redirected to the login page
   - Sign in with your Cognito credentials

### Authentication

The application uses AWS Cognito for authentication:
- **Login Required**: All pages require authentication
- **Automatic Redirect**: Unauthenticated users are redirected to `/login`
- **Session Management**: Sessions are automatically refreshed
- **Logout**: Users can logout from the top right menu

### Configuration

1. After logging in, you'll be prompted to configure your S3 bucket.
2. Enter your S3 bucket name in the configuration modal.
3. The application will use the AWS credentials from your environment variables to access the bucket.
